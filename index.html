  <p><em><strong>About us</strong></em></p>
  <p>Euclase Stone is by far the hardest, most durable engineered quartz on the market today. It’s composed of natural stone & resin. We have focused our research and development in the manufacturing of quartz products only. We carry a large selection of quartz slabs for the residential, commercial, hospitality, and healthcare markets.  Traveling the world to find the most beautiful natural stones, we create natural looking designs and textures using state of the art, innovative manufacturing techniques and processes. We are here to help you realize your desires–quartz that looks so natural you can’t tell it’s engineered. Quartz has quickly become the most durable and maintenance-free product for your kitchen countertops, vanities, backsplashes, wet bars, window decks, and furniture adding value to your home and projects. Much more affordable than natural stone, the long lasting beauty of Euclase Stone will provide a timeless look for years to come.
We thrive to overwhelm our customers with service, with excellence, and with Euclase love!</p>
